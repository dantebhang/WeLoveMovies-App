# We Love Movies

WeLoveMovies is a web full-stack application which involves a database and routes for users to gain access to information and rewview on movies and what is playing in currently playing in theaters. 
A provided React [front-end application](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-movie-front-end) was incorporated to my [back-end](https://github.com/dantebhang/WeLoveMovies-backend) project to give a more visual representation of the server-side implementation.  <br>
